# Bike Sharing Service

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, Pandas is used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations is created in Tableau to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
