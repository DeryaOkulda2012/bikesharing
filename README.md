# Bike Sharing Service

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, Pandas is used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations is created in Tableau to:

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Two visualizations showing geographic locations of bike trip starts and trip ending locations.
